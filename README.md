HAP
====

HAP is a family of video codecs which perform decompression using a computer's graphics hardware, substantially reducing the CPU usage necessary to play video â€” this is useful in situations where CPU power is a limiting factor, such as when working with multiple high resolution videos in real-time.


About HAP
----

More information about HAP as well as resources for users and developers are available on the [HAP site](http://hap.video).


Specification and Reference Source
----

This repository hosts the [HAP specification](https://github.com/Vidvox/hap/tree/master/documentation) and [reference source code](https://github.com/Vidvox/hap/tree/master/source) for encoding and decoding HAP frames. It will be of interest to those implementing their own decoder or encoder.


Test Materials
----

Developers of decoders may find the following packs of material useful for testing:

 * [Odd Dimensions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vidvox/hap/Hap_Test_Odd_Dimensions.zip): Samples with irregular dimensions (2 MB zip)
 * [16K](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vidvox/hap/Hap_Test_16K.zip): Samples at high resolution (35 MB zip)
 * [FFmpeg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vidvox/hap/Hap_Test_FFmpeg.zip): Samples encoded using FFmpeg (24 MB zip)
